SQLarius: Wake up…
SQLarius: Come on, you’re not gone yet.
MainCharacter: Who—?
SQLarius: SQLarius. Or what’s left of him.
MainCharacter: What happened here?
SQLarius: My power — stolen.
SQLarius: Everything I built, every defense I left in place,
SQLarius: ripped out by the ones who call themselves hackers.
SQLarius: It wasn’t ordinary magic. It was SQL Injection —
SQLarius: the kind that let me shape data, bend commands, and rebuild what was broken.”
SQLarius: They took it and scattered the fragments through this place.
SQLarius: You were my contingency. My last vault.
MainCharacter: I don’t understand. Why me?
SQLarius: Because you still hold what I lost —
SQLarius: not the knowledge, not the control…
SQLarius: but the raw magic.
SQLarius: It’s inside you, even if you don’t know how to use it.
SQLarius: That’s why I woke you. You’ll move where I can’t.
SQLarius: I’ll teach. You’ll act.
MainCharacter: So you’re the brain, and I’m the muscle.
SQLarius: Close enough.
SQLarius: You have something I can’t reclaim on my own.
SQLarius: And I know how to make it mean something before they break the rest of this world.
MainCharacter: Feels like it’s already trying to burn through me.
SQLarius: Then we start before it does.
SQLarius: There’s a door to your right. It leads out of this tomb and into what remains of The Root Courtyard —
SQLarius: a place I once used to keep things organized. We’ll need it again.
