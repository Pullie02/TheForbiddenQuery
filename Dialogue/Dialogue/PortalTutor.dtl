SQLarius: You made it. This is the Root Courtyard — empty most days now.
SQLarius: It’s the connector for the campus buildings. Quiet, but not broken.
MainCharacter: Feels… too calm.
SQLarius: The buildings here are more than architecture —
SQLarius: they’re gateways. The L Building, the P Building, and the E Building.
SQLarius: Each holds a section I used to manage.
MainCharacter: You said your power was stolen. Why these buildings?
SQLarius: Because those were the nodes of my work. They’re where I forged tools and set defenses.
SQLarius: The thieves took my magic — my SQL Injection — from me alone.
SQLarius: Everyone else still carries theirs; only mine is gone.
MainCharacter: So only you were targeted.
SQLarius: Yes. They hit the source. And they left firewalls where doors used to be —
SQLarius: deliberate blocks that refuse my access. You, however, still register inside those systems.
SQLarius: That’s why I woke you.
MainCharacter: I don’t know how to use any of it.
MainCharacter: I barely know what you’re talking about.
SQLarius: You don’t need to know everything yet. You need to move. I’ll explain while you act.
SQLarius: The L Building — the Lab — is the first place to go.
SQLarius: It’s where I tested the core of SQL Injection spells. It will teach you how the power responds before you learn to shape it.
SQLarius: Now, go to the L Building and then press the E key to enter.
